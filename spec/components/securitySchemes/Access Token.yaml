  > Your access token will allow you to use the service in the same way in which
  you may use it if you log in on the web portal. You will have the same
  permissions unless specified otherwise creation of the token. This implies
  that anyone who has this token can log in as yourself to the service. Do not
  share your personal access token with anyone else, and only use it with HTTPS!


  To get an access token, you will need to log in on the web portal and [create
  one](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/settings), as shown below.

  In this dialog, `scopes` lets you define permissions for the token which by
  default only include read access to your drafts and records.

  Clicking "Submit" will generate and show your personal token in the browser.
  Please copy it to a safe place on your computer, as it is not stored on the
  portal and you will not be able to retrieve the same token again in the
  future.
